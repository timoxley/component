Dependencies\r\n  are resolved and the component contents are downloaded into\r\n  `./components` by default. View `component help install` for details.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ component install component/tip\r\n\r\n   install : component/tip@master\r\n       dep : component/emitter@master\r\n   install : component/emitter@master\r\n       dep : component/jquery@master\r\n   install : component/jquery@master\r\n     fetch : component/tip:index.js\r\n     fetch : component/tip:tip.css\r\n     fetch : component/tip:tip.html\r\n     fetch : component/emitter:index.js\r\n     fetch : component/jquery:index.js\r\n  complete : component/emitter\r\n  complete : component/jquery\r\n  complete : component/tip\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Searching for components\r\n\r\n  By adding your component to the [Components List](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Components) wiki page it will become automatically available to `component-search(1)`. When invoked with no query all components are displayed, otherwise a filtered search, ordered by the number of github \"stars\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ component search ui\r\n\r\n  component/dialog\r\n  url: https://github.com/component/dialog\r\n  desc: Dialog component\r\n  ★ 12\r\n\r\n  component/notification\r\n  url: https://github.com/component/notification\r\n  desc: Notification component\r\n  ★ 10\r\n\r\n  component/overlay\r\n  url: https://github.com/component/overlay\r\n  desc: Overlay component\r\n  ★ 7\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Github as a registry\r\n\r\n  By using GitHub as the registry, `component(1)` is automatically\r\n  available to you without further explicit knowledge or work\r\n  creating a registry account etc.\r\n\r\n  A nice side-effect of this namespaced world is that dependencies\r\n  are explicit and self-documenting. No longer do you need to query\r\n  the registry for a \"repo\" property that may not exist, it's simply\r\n  built in to the package name, for example [\"visionmedia/page.js\"](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) rather\r\n  than the unclear \"page\".\r\n\r\n  Another benefit of this is that there are zero name collisions, for example\r\n  you may use \"component/tip\" for a dependency of \"foo\", and \"someuser/tip\"\r\n  as a dependency of \"bar\", providing `require('tip')` in each. This prevents\r\n  obscure or irrelevant naming such as \"progress\", \"progress2\", \"progress-bar\",\r\n  \"progress-component\" found in npm.\r\n\r\n## Creating a component\r\n\r\n  The `component-create(1)` command can create a component\r\n  project skeleton for you by filling out the prompts. Once\r\n  this repo is published to Github, you're all done!\r\n\r\n```\r\nname: popover\r\ndescription: Popover UI component\r\ndoes this component have js? yes\r\ndoes this component have css? yes\r\ndoes this component have html? yes\r\n\r\n     create : popover\r\n     create : popover/index.js\r\n     create : popover/template.html\r\n     create : popover/popover.css\r\n     create : popover/Makefile\r\n     create : popover/Readme.md\r\n     create : popover/.gitignore\r\n     create : popover/component.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  A `Makefile` is created for you in order to create a build of the component,\r\n  complete with installed dependencies simply execute `make`.\r\n\r\n## Templates\r\n\r\n  Because `component(1)` has no notion of a \"template\", even simple HTML files\r\n  should be converted to a `require()`-able module. It is recommended that public\r\n  components shared within the community use regular HTML templates, and regular\r\n  CSS stylesheets to maximize contributions, however if you wish to use alternate\r\n  technologies just make sure to compile them before publishing them to Github.\r\n\r\n  For the recommended use-case of regular HTML, the `component-convert(1)` command\r\n  will translate a regular HTML file to its `require()`-able JavaScript counterpart.\r\n\r\n## Developing component(1) sub-commands\r\n\r\n  `component(1)` and sub-commands are structured much like `git(1)`,\r\n  in that sub-commands are simply separate executables. For example\r\n  `$ component info pkg` and `$ component-info pkg` are equivalent.\r\n\r\n  Because of this you'll likely want `PATH=\"./bin:$PATH\"` in your\r\n  profile or session while developing component, otherwise `./bin/component`\r\n  will have a hard time finding the sub-commands.\r\n\r\n## Running tests\r\n\r\nMake sure dependencies are installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Shout-outs\r\n\r\n  The concept of components themselves are nothing new, Drupal\r\n  for example has been doing this for years, however it seemed the concept was never\r\n  really translated to the client. My hope is that other communities will re-implement this\r\n  simple tool in their language of choice (or use this one) so that we can all consume components\r\n  easily.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n  - TJ Holowaychuk\r\n  - Guillermo Rauch\r\n  - Garrett Johnson\r\n  - Amir Abu Shareb\r\n  - Adam Sanderson\r\n  - Matt Mueller\r\n  - Forbes Lindesay\r\n  - Arpad Borsos\r\n  - Dan Williams\r\n  - Damián Suárez\r\n  - Tim Oxley\r\n  - Jeremy Worboys\r\n\r\n## Example applications\r\n\r\n  Open source application examples:\r\n\r\n  - [Todo list](https://github.com/component/todo)\r\n  - [Component.io](https://github.com/component/component.io)\r\n  - [Posty](https://github.com/visionmedia/posty)\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\n - [component-graph(1)](https://github.com/component/component-graph) dependency graphs for component projects\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n"}
